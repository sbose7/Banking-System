# Battleship
A simple simulation of battleship game written in Java language using Swing library.

The program scans ships.txt file for the user's ship layout and generates a random layout for computer. The user can take a shot by pushing a button and will be 
informed whether the shot missed, hit or destroyed a ship. The computer randomly chooses places to shoot. The first one to destroy all ships wins.
